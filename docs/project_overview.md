# Beat The Heat - Project Overview

## üì± Application Overview
Beat The Heat is a Flutter-based mobile and web application that provides personalized heat risk assessment and safety recommendations. The app is designed with a privacy-first approach, processing all data locally without requiring a backend server.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Data Layer
- **In-Memory Storage**
  - `MemoryStorageService`: Handles runtime data storage
  - `SessionData`: Manages user profile and session information
  - No persistent storage for privacy

- **Services**
  - `WeatherService`: Interfaces with weather APIs
  - `LocationService`: Handles geolocation
  - `ConnectivityService`: Manages online/offline states
  - `RiskCalculator`: Computes heat risk scores

### UI Layer
- **Screens**
  - `HomeScreen`: Main interface showing weather and risk information
  - Responsive design supporting mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts

- **Widgets**
  - `ConsentDialog`: User privacy management
  - `LocationIndicator`: Location display
  - `OfflineStatusIndicators`: Network status
  - Custom loading and skeleton screens

### Utils
- `ResponsiveUtils`: Screen size adaptation
- `SafetyRecommendationsEngine`: Generates contextual safety advice
- `RiskCalculator`: Heat index and risk score computation
