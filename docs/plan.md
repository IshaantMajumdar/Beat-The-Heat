# Heat Risk App Development Plan

## Overview
A standalone Flutter-based heat risk assessment application that runs on mobile and web platforms. The app combines user health data with local weather information to calculate personalized heat risk indicators.

## Core Features

### 1. User Consent Management
- Privacy-first approach with clear consent screens
- Detailed explanation of data usage and storage
- Option to revoke consent and delete data
- Local data storage compliance

### 2. User Profile & Health Data Collection
- Basic Demographics
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Weight and Height
- Health Information
  - Pre-existing conditions
  - Medications
  - Heat sensitivity history
  - Physical activity level
- Data stored locally using secure storage

### 3. Location Services
- Geolocation integration
  - City/State/Country
  - Area-specific location
- Permission handling
- Background location updates (optional)
- Fallback for manual location entry

### 4. Weather Integration
- Real-time weather data fetching
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - UV Index
  - Heat Index
- Weather forecast integration
- Local caching for offline access
- Multiple weather API providers for reliability

### 5. Risk Assessment Engine
- Customized risk calculation algorithms considering:
  - Current weather conditions
  - User health profile
  - Activity level
  - Time of day
- Risk level categorization
  - Low
  - Moderate
  - High
  - Extreme
- Personalized safety recommendations

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Data Layer
- In-Memory Storage
  - Runtime data structures for user profile
  - Temporary session storage for health data
  - No persistent storage (data cleared on app closure)
- API Integration
  - Weather API client
  - Geolocation services
  - Error handling and retry logic

### 2. Business Logic Layer
- Risk Calculation Service
- Weather Service
- Location Service
- Profile Management Service
- Consent Management Service

### 3. Presentation Layer
- Material Design 3.0 implementation
- Responsive layouts for web/mobile
- Accessibility features
- Dark/Light theme support
